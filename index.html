        <p> This project displays a sequence of drawings that display the cycle of growing up and getting old. 
          Growing old is often looked upon as a negative,
          as many of us strive to obtain our youth, and glow. 
          So much focus is put on this that we often forget that there is beauty with 
          getting old. Even though there are some things that change, like hair color, 
          and skin texture, we gain new things like, wisdom, 
          discernment and patience. This small cycle is depicted through an original character 
          that is indicative of myself. This piece and 
          character allowed me to reflect not only on my life thus far, but also forced me to 
          realize just how short life really is. 
          If anything, through my character Madison, I was able to learn the importance of appreciating 
          oneself at every stage! As difficult as this may be, it is an important step to understanding that 
          life is not constant, and change is inevitable and must be embraced. We cannot escape change, 
          nor the storms life throws our way, but what we can control is how we respond to our cloudiest and brightest days. </p>
